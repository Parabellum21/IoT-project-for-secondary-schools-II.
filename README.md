My bachelor's thesis

# Abstract
The aim of this bachelor thesis is to create an educational project in the field of Internet of Things (IoT) that can be further implemented in a course of study. The target audience of this project is high school students who already have a basic knowledge of programming. However, the project can also be useful for adults who have no experience with IoT and want to understand its basics. During the development of this project, students will be introduced to the basics of IoT and electronics. This work has practical use and could be included in school teaching plans as a supplementary course. It will allow students to deepen their knowledge of programming and develop their skills in creating IoT projects. Therefore, the aim of this bachelor project is to help the young generation of programmers to understand the fundamentals of IoT and to provide them with practical experience in developing IoT projects.
